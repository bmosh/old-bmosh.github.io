              As an AI/ML Engineering Intern at the <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a> in the Summer of 2023, I led
              algorithm implementation and evaluation on a project that searched to ensure outcome fairness for legally protected groups in large-scale national
              security decision processes. This opportunity arose when the previous lead left to pursue a congressional fellowship, and I
              recognized my skills in PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and other python libraries were strong enough to add to the project’s codebase. After stepping up, 
              my work allowed our team to effectively test algorithmic debiasing performance in a variety of ways, and report our findings to our sponsor on our original timeline.

              I was recruited to join the <a href="https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie/research/oracl"><i>OR Advances through Collaboration</i></a> research program at Cornell by my Engineering Statistics and Probability II professor in September 2022. 
              My first assignment was to the GM Team, as a co-lead for a team of 14 leading correspondence with the GM Advanced Analytics Center. 
              Our team would work with them to model the potential impact of a shift from the dealership sales model, to more closely approximate the simplified direct sale model that companies like Tesla have been implementing in recent years. 
              After one semester, I was moved to lead a team of my own, working with the Mars Wrigley company on their advertising models and retail demand forecasting.

                I joined the <a href="https://richardson.cee.cornell.edu/">Richardson Lab of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> in February 2022, and was originally tasked with developing ImageJ scripts to automate the time-intensive process of algae classification and toxin level prediction. 
                While working on this assignment, I realized that there was potential to automate the entire process, from the moment our volunteers submit data to when the predictions are returned to them. 
                I earned a research grant from the university to continue my work over summer 2022, and during that time I implemented this full automation using Python, PowerShell, and the Google Drive and Mail APIs. 
                Now, I am working to shift our system away from the Google Ecosystem with a redesigned standalone website, submission form and SQL Server to increase volunteer accessibility and trust in the program.

                I was accepted to the Engineers for a Sustainable World project team on the Biofuels/Bioenergy Implementation subteam during the fall of my freshman year. 
                I quickly rose to subteam lead, reorganizing our project base and managing team recruitment. 
                My team worked with the Barstow Lab of Biological and Environmental Engineering to research and provide economic analysis on alternative rare earth extraction processes under a DARPA grant. 
                We also worked on a project to convert waste fats, oils, and greases from campus dining halls and Greek life houses into usable biodiesel for campus tractors in the summer months. 
                I was a part of this team until the end of sophomore fall, allowing my successor to take over as my academic priorities had changed from chemical engineering to CS+ORIE by then.
